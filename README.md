# Programming 2 Individual Project
### By: Ethan Reynolds

## MLB Stadium Tracker
I am going to do an app with two different apps inside of it. The first app is going to be an app where you can store inforation about the MLB stadiums you have been to. I am thinking I will either use an array list or a linked list to store the data but I'm still figuring that out. The second app is a MLB Team Name guesser. It will let you guesses and every wrong guess it will tell you more information about the team. As of now I am thinking that these apps will share a 2 dimensional array formatted as a table. The apps will have accses to the array through inheritance. 

The data I will need is the data for the MLB teams such as stadium, division, leauge, etc.

#### Year 2 Concepts
* GUI Controls (Text Box, and Buttons)
* Inheritance
* Multidimensional Arrays
* Writing and Reading from a file

* Unfortunately, I was only able to get this to function for Truist Park.

#### Executable 
* [Mac M1](https://github.com/SFgiantsfan/Programming-2-Individual-Projects-2022-2023/blob/main/app/macos-aarch64.zip)
* [Windows](https://github.com/SFgiantsfan/Programming-2-Individual-Projects-2022-2023/blob/main/app/windows-amd64.zip)

For some reason my home computer only lets me do Windows so I'll update with Mac when I get back to school.
